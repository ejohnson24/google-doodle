# Dogsledding Google Doodle
This logo is meant to represent the sport of dogsledding, and give a feeling for dogsledding. The environment is supposed to be wintery, adventorous, and outdoors. Dogsleds were used for a long time by explorers in the Arctic, because they were easier than horses - this theme of exploration is shown through the revolving background of wilderness and mountains. The colors are mostly soft, pale blues and greys, to help give it this wintery feeling. The red is used to highlight the characters, to help seperate them from the background.
